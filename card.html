            <p class="description">Bald eagles are large birds of prey native to North America.
               Since 1782, the bald eagle has been the United States' national
               emblem and mascot. The bald eagle isn't actually bald; it gets its 
               name because its white head against its dark brown body makes it seem 
               bald from a distance.
